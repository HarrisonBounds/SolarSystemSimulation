Simulates the orbits of the planets around the Sun using real equations from physics scaled down

This program uses the gravitational attraction between planets, mass, and velocity to simulate the orbit of the planets around our Sun.
I had a wonderful time making this and understanding the math and physics behind this project is an added bonus.

A couple of things to note:

1. The orbits look circular in the program, but in reality they are ellipses. The reason they appear this way is because the program is scaled down, fitting the 
   orbit to a circular path
   
2. Neptune is not visible in the program for the same reason above. Since the program window is too small, neptune is off screen. Instead of tweaking the values to
   bring Neptune closer, I decided to stay as true to the orbits as I could by leaving their values to what they actually are.
